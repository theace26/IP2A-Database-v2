# IP2A-Database-v2: Project Context Document

**Document Purpose:** Bring Claude (Code or AI) up to speed for development sessions
**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026 (ADR-019 Implementation)
**Current Version:** v0.9.24-alpha (Developer Super Admin with View As Impersonation)
**Current Phase:** Post-Phase 8A | Developer Tools | 19 ADRs | Spoke 3 (Infrastructure)

---

## TL;DR

**What:** Union operations management system for IBEW Local 46 (Seattle-area electrical workers union)

**Who:** Xerxes - Business Representative by day, solo developer (5-10 hrs/week)

**Where:** Backend COMPLETE. Frontend FEATURE-COMPLETE (Weeks 1-19). Square payments planned (ADR-018, Stripe removed Week 35). **Deployed to Railway.**

**Stack:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Jinja2 + HTMX + DaisyUI + Alpine.js + WeasyPrint + openpyxl

**Status:** ~806 total tests (764 baseline + 24 developer/view-as + 18 Square), ~327 API endpoints (324 baseline + 3 view-as), 32 models, **19 ADRs**, Railway deployment live, Developer role with View As impersonation (ADR-019), Square payment integration live (ADR-018), Grant compliance complete, Mobile PWA enabled, Analytics dashboard live

**Current:** **ADR-019 COMPLETE** — Developer super admin role (level 255) with View As UI impersonation. Session-based role switching for QA/development. View As dropdown in navbar, impersonation banner, 24+ tests. **DEV/DEMO ONLY - NEVER PRODUCTION.** Three API endpoints (/api/v1/view-as/*), comprehensive permission system. **NEXT:** Production deployment verification (no developer accounts in prod), stakeholder demo, Phase 7 data collection (7a/7d), or Phase 8B (Square Terminal/POS). See `docs/decisions/ADR-019-developer-super-admin.md`

## Development Model: Hub/Spoke

This project uses a **Hub/Spoke model** for planning and coordination via Claude AI projects (claude.ai). This does NOT affect the code architecture — it's about how development conversations are organized.

| Project | Scope | What Goes There |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Hub** | Strategy, architecture, cross-cutting decisions, roadmap, docs | "How should we approach X?" |
| **Spoke 2: Operations** | Dispatch/Referral, Pre-Apprenticeship, SALTing, Benevolence | Phase 7 implementation, instruction docs |
| **Spoke 1: Core Platform** | Members, Dues, Employers, Member Portal | Create when needed |
| **Spoke 3: Infrastructure** | Dashboard/UI, Reports, Documents, Import/Export, Logging | Create when needed |

**What this means for you (Claude Code):**
- You operate directly on the codebase regardless of which Spoke produced the instruction document
- Instruction documents are created in Hub or Spoke projects and provided to you for execution
- If you encounter **cross-cutting concerns** (e.g., changes to `src/main.py`, shared test fixtures in `conftest.py`, or modifications to base templates), note them in your session summary so the user can create a handoff note for the Hub
- The Hub/Spoke model is for human/AI planning coordination, not code architecture. Do not create separate code directories for Spokes.

**Sprint Weeks ≠ Calendar Weeks:** Instruction document "weeks" (Week 20, Week 25, etc.) are sprint numbers, not calendar weeks. At 5-10 hours/week development pace, each sprint takes 1-2 calendar weeks to complete. Do not assume sprint numbers map to specific dates.

## Important Patterns

### Enum Imports
```python
# CORRECT
from src.db.enums import MemberStatus, StudentStatus, CourseEnrollmentStatus

# WRONG (old location)
from src.models.enums import MemberStatus
```

### Service Layer Pattern
All business logic goes through services, not directly in routes.

### Cookie-Based Auth (Week 2)
```python
from src.routers.dependencies.auth_cookie import require_auth

@router.get("/protected")
async def protected_page(
    request: Request,
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_auth),
):
    # Handle redirect
    if isinstance(current_user, RedirectResponse):
        return current_user
    # current_user has: id, email, roles
```

### JWT Secret Key Configuration (CRITICAL - Bug #006 Fix)

**IMPORTANT:** The `AUTH_JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable MUST be set in production.

If not set, a random secret is generated on each container restart, which:
- Invalidates ALL existing user sessions
- Causes "Signature verification failed" errors
- Forces all users to re-login after every deployment

**To Fix (Railway/Production):**
```bash
# 1. Generate a secure key
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'

# 2. Add to Railway environment variables:
AUTH_JWT_SECRET_KEY=<paste-generated-key-here>

# 3. Redeploy
```

**Startup Warning:** If the key is not set, the app logs a warning at startup:
```
WARNING: AUTH_JWT_SECRET_KEY not set in environment!
A random secret was generated. This means:
  - All user sessions will be invalidated on restart
  - Users will see 'Signature verification failed' errors
```

See: `docs/BUGS_LOG.md` Bug #006 for full details.

### Form-Based Login (IMPORTANT - Bug #005 Fix)

The login form uses a **form-based endpoint** that accepts URL-encoded data directly:

```html
<!-- Login form posts to form-based endpoint (NOT /auth/login) -->
<form hx-post="/login">
    <input name="email" type="email">
    <input name="password" type="password">
</form>
```

**Two Login Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Content-Type | Use Case |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `POST /login` | Form data | HTML forms (HTMX) - in `frontend.py` |
| `POST /auth/login` | JSON | API clients (mobile apps) - in `auth.py` |

**Why:** The HTMX `json-enc` extension was unreliable in production. Instead of converting form data to JSON, we accept form data directly using FastAPI's `Form()` parameters.

```python
# frontend.py - accepts form data
@router.post("/login")
async def login_form_submit(
    email: str = Form(...),
    password: str = Form(...),
):
    user = authenticate_user(db, email, password)
    # ... set cookies and return
```

See: `docs/BUGS_LOG.md` Bug #005 for full details.

### System Setup Flow

The system has a first-time setup flow that requires creating a personal administrator account:

1. **Default Admin Account** (`admin@ibew46.com`)
   - Seeded automatically on deployment
   - Cannot be deleted or have email/password changed via setup page
   - CAN be disabled via checkbox during setup (recommended for production)
   - Can be re-enabled later from Staff Management

2. **Setup Required When**
   - No users exist at all
   - Only the default admin account exists

3. **Setup Process**
   - User must create their own administrator account
   - Optionally disable the default admin account
   - Default admin email cannot be used for the new account

```python
from src.services.setup_service import (
    is_setup_required,
    get_default_admin_status,
    create_setup_user,
    disable_default_admin,
    DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL,
)

# Check if setup is needed
if is_setup_required(db):
    # Show setup page

# Create user during setup
create_setup_user(
    db=db,
    email="user@example.com",
    password="SecurePass@247!",
    first_name="John",
    last_name="Doe",
    role="admin",
    disable_default_admin_account=True,  # Optional
)
```

### Template Rendering
```python
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="src/templates")

@router.get("/page")
async def page(request: Request):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("page.html", {"request": request})
```

### HTMX Form Pattern
```html
<form hx-post="/auth/login" hx-target="#result" hx-swap="innerHTML">
    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### HTMX Search Pattern (Week 3/4)
```html
<input
    type="search"
    name="q"
    hx-get="/training/students/search"
    hx-trigger="input changed delay:300ms, search"
    hx-target="#table-container"
    hx-include="[name='status'], [name='cohort']"
/>
```

### HTMX 401 Error Handling (Bug #022 Fix)

When HTMX requests return 401 (session expired), the backend should include the `HX-Redirect` header:

```python
# In router endpoints for HTMX partials
if isinstance(current_user, RedirectResponse):
    return HTMLResponse(
        "Session expired",
        status_code=401,
        headers={"HX-Redirect": "/auth/login?next=/current/path"},
    )
```

The frontend JavaScript also handles 401 with automatic redirect:

```javascript
// src/static/js/app.js
if (status === 401) {
    showToast('Session expired. Redirecting to login...', 'warning');
    setTimeout(function() {
        window.location.href = '/auth/login?next=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname);
    }, 1000);
    return;
}
```

### Synchronous Database Sessions (Bug #024 Fix)

**IMPORTANT:** This codebase uses **synchronous** SQLAlchemy sessions, NOT async.

```python
# CORRECT - synchronous
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def some_function(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    result = db.execute(stmt)  # NO await
    items = result.scalars().all()

# WRONG - async (will cause 500 errors)
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

async def some_function(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    result = await db.execute(stmt)  # FAILS - get_db returns sync session
```

## Production Deployment (Railway)

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection | Auto-set by Railway |
| `AUTH_JWT_SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing key | **YES - CRITICAL** |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | admin@ibew46.com password | YES |
| `IP2A_ENV` | Environment (`prod`) | Recommended |
| `RUN_PRODUCTION_SEED` | One-time seed flag | Set to `false` after initial |

### Generate JWT Secret Key
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### Common Deployment Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Container restart loop | `RUN_PRODUCTION_SEED=true` | Set to `false` |
| "Signature verification failed" | `AUTH_JWT_SECRET_KEY` not set | Add the env var |
| Users can't log in | Old browser cookies | Cookies now auto-clear on invalid token |
| Health check fails | Production seed error (KeyError) | Ensure latest code deployed |
| passlib errors | Bcrypt compatibility | Code uses direct bcrypt now |
| Enum value errors | Old seed data | Update to current enum values |
| Reports page 500 error | `category.items` dict conflict (Bug #013) | Fixed in `013cf92` |
| SQLAlchemy cartesian product warning | Count query with selectinload (Bug #014) | Fixed in `013cf92` |
| Truncate transaction abort | Missing table aborts transaction (Bug #018) | Fixed with SAVEPOINTs in `ca54c6a` |
| StudentStatus.GRADUATED error | Wrong enum value in seed (Bug #017) | Use COMPLETED not GRADUATED |
| Migration is_system_role NOT NULL | Raw SQL INSERT missing column (Bug #020) | Fixed in `8916563` |
| MemberClassification.JOURNEYMAN_WIREMAN error | Service used non-existent enum values (Bug #021) | Fixed in `70df236` |
| HTMX 401 errors show generic message | Missing status-specific error handling (Bug #022) | Fixed in `8564840` |
| bcrypt `__about__` AttributeError | bcrypt 4.1.x incompatible with passlib (Bug #023) | Pin bcrypt>=4.0.1 |
| Reports 500 error (async/sync mismatch) | Router used `await` with sync Session (Bug #024) | Fixed in `9543c5b` |
| Setup users have no roles | Role assignment failed silently (Bug #025) | Fixed in `2f16502` |
| Member CRUD fails "general_notes doesn't exist" | Model attribute didn't map to DB column (Bug #026) | Fixed with explicit column name |
| Audit log tests fail with wrong columns | Tests used `user_id`/`created_at` vs `changed_by`/`changed_at` (Bug #027) | Fixed in test file |
| Test fixtures use invalid enum values | conftest.py used obsolete strings (Bug #028) | Use enum objects |
| Dispatch frontend tests fail with AttributeError | Service used wrong field names: `Dispatch.status`, `JobBid.status`, `JobBid.bid_time`, `BookRegistration.book_priority_number` (Bug #029) | Fixed 14 field names in `8480366` |

**Note:** As of commit `013cf92`, invalid JWT cookies are automatically cleared on redirect to login, preventing repeated "Signature verification failed" log spam.

### Production Seed Data Counts

The expanded production seed (18 steps) creates:
- **1000** Members
- **500** Students
- **100** Organizations
- **75** Instructors
- **10** Grants
- **200** Expenses
- **15** Cohorts
- **1500** Instructor hour entries (20 per instructor)
- **1000** Tools issued (2 per student)
- **1000** Credentials (2 per student)
- **500** JATC applications (1 per student)
- Plus: Training enrollments, union ops (SALTing, Benevolence, Grievances), dues

### Production Seed Technical Notes

**Truncate Safety (Bug #018 fix):**
The `truncate_all.py` uses PostgreSQL SAVEPOINTs to handle missing tables gracefully:
- Each table truncation is wrapped in a SAVEPOINT
- If a table doesn't exist, the savepoint is rolled back
- Subsequent tables can still be truncated
- Missing tables are logged and skipped

**Seed Idempotency:**
- Seed clears ALL data before inserting (via `truncate_all_tables()`)
- Running seed multiple times produces the same result
- Auth seed checks for existing roles/admin before creating
- Set `RUN_PRODUCTION_SEED=false` after initial seed to prevent re-runs

### Documents Feature Status

The Documents feature is currently disabled with a "Feature not implemented" placeholder page. This feature requires S3/MinIO configuration which will be set up in a future deployment phase. See Bug #016 for details.

### Documentation
- Deployment instructions: `docs/instructions/deployment_instructions/`
- Bugs encountered: `docs/BUGS_LOG.md` (Bugs #006-#019)
- Session log: `docs/reports/session-logs/2026-01-30-deployment-session.md`

## Branching Strategy (January 30, 2026)

**IMPORTANT:** As of January 30, 2026, development occurs on the `develop` branch.

### Branch Overview

| Branch | Purpose | Status | Auto-Deploy |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `main` | Demo/Production | Stable (needs update from develop) | Railway |
| `develop` | Active development | v0.9.4-alpha (FEATURE-COMPLETE) | None (local only) |

**Current Action:** Merge `develop → main` to deploy v0.9.4-alpha feature-complete build to Railway.

**Why Separate Branches:**
- `main` is the production branch deployed to Railway
- `develop` allows continued development without affecting demo
- Merge `develop → main` only when ready to update production
- Protects production from showing half-finished features

### Branch Commands

```bash
# Switch to develop (for all development work)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge develop to main (when ready to update demo)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

---

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. `git checkout develop` (ALWAYS work on develop branch)
2. `git pull origin develop`
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. `pytest -v --tb=short` (verify green)
5. Check instruction document for current tasks

### During Session
- Commit incrementally
- Run tests after significant changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- **Stay on develop branch**

### Ending a Session
1. `pytest -v` (verify green)
2. `git status` (check for uncommitted changes)
3. Commit with conventional commit message
4. `git push origin develop` (push to develop, NOT main)
5. Note any blockers or next steps
6. **⚠️ MANDATORY: End-of-session documentation update (see below)**

### 📝 End-of-Session Documentation (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

> Update *ANY* and *ALL* relevant documents to capture progress made this session.
> Scan `/docs/*` and make or create any relevant updates/documents to keep a
> historical record as the project progresses. Do not forget about ADRs —
> update as necessary.

**Before closing the session:**
1. **Scan `/docs/*`** — Review all documentation files
2. **Update existing docs** — Reflect changes, progress, and decisions
3. **Create new docs** — If needed for new components or concepts
4. **ADR Review** — Update or create Architecture Decision Records as necessary
5. **Session log entry** — Record what was accomplished in `docs/reports/session-logs/`
6. **CHANGELOG.md** — Add entries for work completed
7. **CLAUDE.md** — Update current state if significant progress made

This ensures historical record-keeping and project continuity ("bus factor" protection).
See `docs/standards/END_OF_SESSION_DOCUMENTATION.md` for full checklist.

## Stripe Payment Integration (January 30, 2026)

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED:** Stripe is being replaced by Square (ADR-018, accepted February 5, 2026). All Stripe tests skip-marked. Migration planned after Phase 7 stabilization. See [ADR-018](docs/decisions/ADR-018-square-payment-integration.md) for rationale and migration plan.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPLETE** - All 3 phases implemented (Backend + Database + Frontend) | **Deprecated** - Migrating to Square

### Overview

Stripe integration enables online dues payment for IBEW Local 46 members. Decision documented in [ADR-013](docs/decisions/ADR-013-stripe-payment-integration.md) (superseded by ADR-018).

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Stripe over Square** | Better developer experience, superior subscription support, ACH support |
| **Checkout Sessions** | PCI compliance stays with Stripe, simpler integration |
| **Payment Methods** | Credit/debit cards (2.9% + $0.30), ACH bank transfers (0.8%, $5 cap) |
| **Webhook Verification** | Never trust redirects alone, always verify via webhook signature |

### Implementation Status

**Phase 1: Backend (Completed January 30, 2026)**

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| PaymentService | ✅ Complete | `src/services/payment_service.py` |

| Frontend tests | ✅ Complete | `src/tests/test_stripe_frontend.py` (14 tests) |

### Environment Variables Needed

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

### Database Changes Required

```sql
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE;

-- DuesPayment payment_method enum needs:
-- 'stripe_card', 'stripe_ach'
```

### Integration Flow

```
Member → "Pay Dues" button → Backend creates Checkout Session
                          → Redirect to Stripe hosted page
                          → Member pays
                          → Stripe webhook fires
                          → Backend records payment in DuesPayment table
```

### Test Mode Setup

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Forward webhooks to local dev
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/v1/webhooks/stripe

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

**Test Cards:**
- Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- 3D Secure: 4000 0000 0000 3220

### Future Enhancements

- Phase 1: One-time payments (use `mode='payment'`)
- Phase 2: Recurring subscriptions (use `mode='subscription'`)
- Phase 3: Payment plans for large balances
- Phase 4: Stripe Customer Portal for member self-service
- Phase 5: QuickBooks integration for accounting sync

**Reference:** See [docs/instructions/stripe/CONTINUITY_STRIPE_UPDATED.md](docs/instructions/stripe/CONTINUITY_STRIPE_UPDATED.md) for full implementation guide.

## Square Payment Integration (February 8, 2026)

**Status:** 🚧 **Week 47 IN PROGRESS** - Square SDK integration and service layer implemented

### Overview

Square will replace Stripe as the payment processor for UnionCore. Decision documented in [ADR-018](docs/decisions/ADR-018-square-payment-integration.md) (supersedes ADR-013).

**Rationale:** The union hall already uses Square for in-person payments. Running two payment ecosystems (Square for walk-ins, Stripe for online) creates operational inefficiency and reconciliation burden. Square migration unifies all payments into a single system.

### Migration Phases

| Phase | Scope | Type | Hours Est. | Status |
|-------|-------|------|------------|--------|
| **Phase A (Week 47-49)** | Replace Stripe → Square online payments | Migration (direct swap) | 15-20 | 🚧 **Week 47 In Progress** |
| **Phase B** | Square Terminal/POS at union hall | New feature | 10-15 | Future |
| **Phase C** | Square Invoices for dues billing | New feature | 10-15 | Future |

**Phasing Rules:**
- Phase A must complete before removing Stripe code
- Phases B & C are independent enhancements
- Phases B & C should not block Phase 7 stabilization

### Week 47 Progress (February 8, 2026)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Square SDK installed (`squareup>=35.0.0`)
- ✅ Configuration added to `.env.example` and `src/config/settings.py`
- ✅ `SquarePaymentService` created at `src/services/square_payment_service.py`
  - `create_payment()` - Process payments via Square Web Payments SDK nonces
  - `get_payment_status()` - Query payment status from Square API
  - `process_refund()` - Refund processing with audit trails
  - `verify_webhook()` - Webhook signature verification
- ✅ `dues_payments` added to `AUDITED_TABLES` (7-year NLRA compliance)
- ✅ Stripe code verified as fully archived (only in historical migrations)

**Technical Notes:**
- Square client import: `from square.client import Square` (not `Client`)
- DuesPayment model uses existing `reference_number` field for Square payment ID
- All payment operations logged via `audit_service.log_update()`

### Week 48 Progress (February 8, 2026)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Payment API router created (`src/routers/square_payments.py`)
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/process` - Process payment with Square nonce
  - `GET /api/v1/payments/{square_payment_id}` - Query payment status
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/{square_payment_id}/refund` - Process refunds (Officer+ only)
  - `POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks/square` - Webhook handler with signature verification
- ✅ Frontend payment form with Square Web Payments SDK (`src/templates/dues/payments/pay.html`)
  - Client-side card tokenization (PCI SAQ-A compliant)
  - Square SDK loaded conditionally (sandbox vs production)
  - Real-time payment processing with error handling
  - Automatic redirect to success page after payment
- ✅ Payment initiation route added to dues_frontend (`/dues/payments/initiate/{member_id}/{period_id}`)
  - Creates or retrieves DuesPayment record
  - Calculates amount from member's dues rate
  - Passes Square config to template (APPLICATION_ID, LOCATION_ID)
- ✅ "Pay Now Online" button updated in member payment history (`src/templates/dues/payments/member.html`)
- ✅ Router registered in main.py (cross-cutting change)

**Technical Notes:**
- Payment flow: Member clicks "Pay Now" → Payment form with Square SDK → Card tokenized client-side → Nonce sent to `/api/v1/payments/process` → SquarePaymentService processes → Success redirect
- All API endpoints require authentication via `require_auth` dependency
- Webhook endpoint has NO auth (Square's signature verification replaces auth)
- Config passed to template via `settings` object (SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT, APPLICATION_ID, LOCATION_ID)

**Cross-Cutting Changes:**
- `src/main.py` - Added square_payments_router registration
- `src/routers/dues_frontend.py` - Added settings import + payment initiation route

### Week 49 Progress (February 8, 2026)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created (`src/tests/test_square_payments.py`)
  - 8 service tests: create_payment (success/failure/exception), get_payment_status, process_refund
  - 4 API router tests: POST /process, GET /{id}, POST /{id}/refund, webhook endpoint
  - 6 webhook tests: signature verification, payment.completed, payment.failed, refund.created
  - **Total: 18 tests** — all Square API calls fully mocked
- ✅ Stripe skip markers verified as already removed (Week 35 cleanup)
- ✅ ADR-018 updated with Phase A completion status
  - Added implementation summary for Weeks 47-49
  - Documented files created/modified
  - Marked Phase A as COMPLETE, Phase B/C as pending
- ✅ Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- ✅ Version bumped to v0.9.23-alpha

**Test Coverage:**
- All Square API calls mocked (no sandbox dependency)
- Error handling: payment failures, exceptions, invalid signatures
- Success paths: payment processing, status queries, refunds
- Webhook event handling: completed, failed, refund events
- Authentication: endpoints require auth except webhook (signature verification)

**Phase 8A Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Square SDK integrated and functional
- Payment flow: member → form → Square tokenization → backend processing → audit trail
- PCI SAQ-A compliance maintained (card data never touches server)
- 18 comprehensive tests covering all code paths
- ADR-018 updated with full implementation details

### Key Decisions (from ADR-018)

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Square over Stripe** | Operational integration — one payment ecosystem instead of two |
| **Client-side tokenization** | PCI compliance (SAQ-A) maintained, card data never touches server |
| **Service layer abstraction** | `SquarePaymentService` replaces `StripePaymentService` with same interface |
| **Processor-agnostic DB column** | Rename `stripe_payment_id` → `processor_payment_id` for future flexibility |

### Test Cleanup (February 5, 2026)

All Stripe tests skip-marked as deprecated:
- `src/tests/test_stripe_integration.py` — 13 tests skipped
- `src/tests/test_stripe_frontend.py` — 14 tests skipped
- **Total:** 27 tests skipped (will be removed during Square migration Phase A)

**Reference:** See [ADR-018](docs/decisions/ADR-018-square-payment-integration.md) for full technical architecture and migration plan.

## Developer Super Admin with View As Impersonation (February 10, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - ADR-019 fully implemented

### Overview

Implements a developer-only super admin role (level 255) with "View As" UI impersonation capability. This enables comprehensive QA testing across all role perspectives without maintaining 8+ separate test accounts. **CRITICAL:** Developer role must NEVER exist in production environments.

**Decision Document:** [ADR-019](docs/decisions/ADR-019-developer-super-admin.md)

### Key Features

**Developer Role (Level 255):**
- Highest privilege level with unrestricted access to all features
- All audit permissions (VIEW_ALL, VIEW_USERS, VIEW_MEMBERS, VIEW_OWN, EXPORT)
- No sensitive field redaction (sees SSN, passwords, bank accounts, etc.)
- Cannot be assigned via UI (seed scripts or direct database manipulation only)
- Seeded automatically in auth_seed.py and demo_seed.py
- **Production Safety:** Deployment checklist must verify no developer accounts exist

**View As Impersonation:**
- Session-based role switching (stored in session, NOT JWT)
- Developer can render UI as any other role (admin, officer, staff, organizer, instructor, member)
- Visible UI indicators: dropdown in navbar, impersonation banner
- Audit logging always records real user (developer), never impersonated role
- API-level permissions NOT bypassed — impersonation only affects UI rendering

### Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Developer role enum | ✅ Complete | `src/db/enums/auth_enums.py` |
| Developer role seed | ✅ Complete | `src/seed/auth_seed.py` |
| Demo developer account | ✅ Complete | `src/db/demo_seed.py` |
| Permissions updated | ✅ Complete | `src/core/permissions.py` |
| View As API (3 endpoints) | ✅ Complete | `src/routers/view_as.py` |
| View As dropdown (navbar) | ✅ Complete | `src/templates/components/_navbar.html` |
| Impersonation banner | ✅ Complete | `src/templates/base.html` |
| Session middleware | ✅ Complete | `src/main.py` (SessionMiddleware) |
| Auth integration | ✅ Complete | `src/routers/dependencies/auth_cookie.py` |
| Comprehensive tests (24+) | ✅ Complete | `src/tests/test_developer_view_as.py` |

### View As API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/v1/view-as/set/{role}` | POST | Set viewing role in session | Developer only |
| `/api/v1/view-as/clear` | POST | Clear impersonation | Developer only |
| `/api/v1/view-as/current` | GET | Get current viewing_as role | Developer only |

**Available Roles for Impersonation:**
- admin, officer, staff, organizer, instructor, member
- Developer cannot impersonate self (not in the list)

### Demo Accounts

| Email | Password | Role | Purpose |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| `demo_developer@ibew46.demo` | `Demo2026!` | developer | QA testing with View As |
| `demo_admin@ibew46.demo` | `Demo2026!` | admin | Regular admin testing |
| `demo_officer@ibew46.demo` | `Demo2026!` | officer | Officer role testing |
| `demo_dispatcher@ibew46.demo` | `Demo2026!` | staff | Dispatcher/staff testing |
| `dev@ibew46.local` | `D3v3l0p3r!` | developer | Production seed developer (dev only) |

### Security Constraints

1. **Production Prohibition:** Developer role MUST NOT exist in production
   - Deployment checklist must verify no users have developer role
   - `dev@ibew46.local` and `demo_developer@ibew46.demo` are dev/demo only

2. **UI Assignment Blocked:** Developer role cannot be assigned through staff management UI
   - Only via seed scripts or direct database manipulation
   - Prevents accidental privilege escalation

3. **Audit Trail Integrity:** When View As is active:
   - Audit logs record real user ID (developer), not impersonated role
   - viewing_as parameter stored in session, not JWT
   - Impersonation banner always visible to indicate active impersonation

4. **Session-Based Storage:**
   - viewing_as stored in HTTP session cookie (`unioncore_session`)
   - Session expires when browser closes
   - NOT stored in JWT token (maintains token integrity)

### UI Components

**View As Dropdown (Navbar):**
- Only visible to users with developer role (hidden from DOM for others)
- Shows current viewing_as role with warning badge style
- Alpine.js powered dropdown with auto-reload on role change
- One-click role selection

**Impersonation Banner:**
- Sticky positioned below navbar when View As is active
- Shows impersonated role (uppercase) and real user email
- Warning alert style (DaisyUI `alert-warning`)
- Quick "Clear View As" button

### Testing

**Test Suite:** `src/tests/test_developer_view_as.py` — **24+ tests**

**Coverage:**
- Developer role existence and enum validation
- Developer authentication and login
- All audit permissions granted
- Sensitive field redaction disabled for developer
- View As API: set role, clear role, get current
- Invalid role rejection (400 error)
- Non-developer access denial (403 error)
- All roles available for impersonation
- Navbar dropdown visibility (developer vs non-developer)
- Impersonation banner display (active vs inactive)
- Session-based storage (not JWT)
- Production safety warnings in role description

  "password": "Demo2026!"
}

# 2. Set View As to staff role
POST /api/v1/view-as/set/staff

# 3. Navigate to any page — UI renders as staff would see it
GET /dashboard
# Sidebar shows only staff-accessible items
# Dashboard cards show staff-scoped data
# Impersonation banner visible at top

# 4. Clear View As
POST /api/v1/view-as/clear
# Returns to full developer view
```

### Production Deployment Checklist

**CRITICAL:** Before deploying to production, verify:

1. ✅ No users in production database have `developer` role
2. ✅ `dev@ibew46.local` account does NOT exist in production
3. ✅ `demo_developer@ibew46.demo` account does NOT exist in production
4. ✅ Developer role seed script is NOT run in production
5. ✅ SessionMiddleware `https_only` set to `true` in production

**Query to Check:**
```sql
SELECT u.email, r.name
FROM users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE r.name = 'developer';
-- Should return 0 rows in production
```

**Version:** v0.9.24-alpha

## Test Verification & Schema Drift Fixes (February 5, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Post-migration test suite verification and critical schema drift fixes

### Overview

Following ISSUE-001 migration drift resolution (Stripe + Grant parallel development), a comprehensive test verification identified and fixed 3 critical schema drift issues affecting 106 tests.

### Issues Fixed

| Issue | Impact | Files Modified | Tests Fixed |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Audit log column mismatch** | Tests used wrong column names (`user_id`/`created_at` vs `changed_by`/`changed_at`) | `test_audit_immutability.py` | 4 |
| **Member notes field conflict** | Model attribute `general_notes` didn't map to DB column `notes` | `member.py`, `member.py` (schema) | ~50 |
| **Test fixture enum values** | conftest.py used obsolete enum values (`journeyman_wireman`, `active`) | `conftest.py` | ~12 |
| **Phase 7 test database** | Used SQLite instead of PostgreSQL (JSONB incompatibility) | `test_phase7_models.py` | N/A |

### Schema Drift Details

**Bug #026: Member Model Column Name Mapping**
- **Problem:** Model defined `general_notes = Column(Text)` without explicit column name
- **Database:** Column named `notes` (not `general_notes`)
- **Impact:** All Member CRUD operations failed with "column 'general_notes' does not exist"
- **Fix:** `general_notes = Column("notes", Text)` + renamed schema fields to match
- **Commit:** (to be added)

**Bug #027: Audit Log Test Column Names**
- **Problem:** Tests used `user_id` and `created_at`, but table has `changed_by` and `changed_at`
- **Fix:** Updated all 4 immutability tests with correct column names
- **Additional:** Shortened test action strings to fit VARCHAR(10) limit

**Bug #028: Test Fixture Enum Values**
- **Problem:** `test_member` fixture used outdated string values instead of enums
- **Fix:** Import enums and use `MemberStatus.ACTIVE`, `MemberClassification.JOURNEYMAN`

### Test Suite Results

| Metric | Before | After Migration | Change |
|--------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Passing** | 389 | 484 | +95 (+24%) |
| **Failing** | 112 | 59 | -53 |
| **Errors** | 89 | 16 | -73 (-82%!) |
| **Pass Rate** | 68% | 86.6% | +18.6 pts |

### Remaining Issues (As of February 5, 2026 - Week 30)

**Week 30 Bug Fix Results:**
- **Pass Rate:** 92.7% (517/558 non-skipped tests) — exceeding 92% target!
- **Improvement:** +10 passing from Bug #029 fix (507 → 517)
- **Bug Fixed:** Bug #029 - Phase 7 model field name mismatches (14 corrections)
- **Session:** Week 30 dispatch field name fix

**Previous Week 29 Results:**
- Pass Rate: 90.9% (507/558 non-skipped tests)
- Session Log: `docs/reports/session-logs/2026-02-05-week29-test-stabilization.md`

**Category 1: Dispatch Frontend Field Names (19 failures) — ✅ FIXED (Week 30)**
- **Root Cause:** Phase 7 model field name mismatches in `dispatch_frontend_service.py`
- **Error:** Multiple AttributeErrors (`Dispatch.status`, `JobBid.status`, `JobBid.bid_time`, `BookRegistration.book_priority_number`)
- **Impact:** 19 dispatch frontend tests blocked → 13 tests unblocked
- **Status:** **Bug #029 FIXED** — Commit `8480366` (February 5, 2026)
- **Resolution:** Corrected 14 field name mismatches to match model definitions
- **Details:** See `docs/historical/BUG_029_DISPATCH_FIELD_NAMES.md`

**Category 2: Phase 7 Model Tests (13 errors) — FLAKY**
- **Root Cause:** Test fixture isolation — tests pass individually but fail together
- **Issue:** Module-scoped cleanup fixture timing or transaction interference
- **Affected:** `test_phase7_models.py` (9 errors on BookRegistration, 3 on RegistrationActivity, 1 on ReferralBook)
- **Resolution:** Requires investigation of fixture cleanup ordering

**Category 3: Member Notes API (5 failures) — TEST REFACTOR NEEDED**
- **Root Cause:** Test fixture isolation — `test_user` not visible to synchronous API client
- **Issue:** `client` fixture uses FastAPI app's separate database session
- **Resolution:** Refactor tests to use `async_client_with_db` or commit test data outside transaction

**Category 4: Dues Tests (4 failures) — QUICK WIN**
- **Root Cause:** Unique constraint violations (year=2093, month=7)
- **Fix:** Add cleanup fixtures (same pattern as Phase 7 fixes in Week 29)
- **Estimated Effort:** 15 minutes
- **Impact:** +4 passing tests → 91.6% pass rate

**Category 5: Referral Frontend (5 failures) — MIXED**
- **Root Cause:** Various (404 errors, NameError, partial rendering issues)
- **Resolution:** Individual investigation needed

**Category 6: Stripe Tests (27 skipped)**
- All Stripe tests skip-marked per ADR-018 (migrating to Square)
- **Resolution:** Will be removed during Square migration Phase A

**Projected Pass Rate with Easy Wins:** Fixing Category 4 (dues cleanup) would yield **93.4%** (521/558 tests passing) — Category 1 already fixed!

```

### Key Schema Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Separate JobBid model** | Cleaner audit trail, supports rejection tracking for 1-year suspension |
| 2 | **MemberTransaction independent** | Separates financial transactions from dues payments |
| 3 | **Per-book exempt status** | Exempt on BookRegistration, not Member (more flexible) |
| 4 | **Field naming standardized** | `registration_number` (APN), `referral_start_time`, etc. |
| 5 | **Dual audit pattern** | Both RegistrationActivity AND audit_logs for NLRA compliance |

### Phase 7 Enums Implemented (19)

`BookClassification`, `BookRegion`, `RegistrationStatus`, `RegistrationAction`, `ExemptReason`, `RolloffReason`, `NoCheckMarkReason`, `LaborRequestStatus`, `BidStatus`, `DispatchMethod`, `DispatchStatus`, `DispatchType`, `TermReason`, `JobClass`, `MemberType`, `ReferralStatus`, `ActivityCode`, `PaymentSource`, `AgreementType`

### Business Rules Implemented in Services

- **30-day re-sign cycle** with automated reminder queries
- **3 check marks = roll-off** with per-book tracking
- **Exempt status** (7 reason types: military, medical, union_business, salting, jury_duty, training, other)
- **Short call position restoration** (max 2 per cycle)
- **FIFO queue ordering** by APN (DECIMAL(10,2))

- **Demo accounts**: 3 role-specific accounts (dispatcher, officer, admin)
- **Business rules demonstrated**: Check marks (Rule 10), exemptions (Rule 14), cross-regional (87%), short calls (Rule 9)

**Files Created:**
```
src/db/demo_seed.py                      # 550+ lines, idempotent demo data
deployment/docker-compose.demo.yml       # Self-contained demo environment
deployment/DEMO_README.md                # Usage guide and smoke test checklist
```

**Docker Usage:**
```bash
cd deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
# Demo available at http://localhost:8080
# Accounts: demo_dispatcher@ibew46.demo / Demo2026! (and officer, admin)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Demo seed script idempotent
- [x] All required entities seeded (books, members, employers, dispatches, check marks, exemptions)
- [x] APNs use correct DECIMAL(10,2) encoding
- [x] Historical data spans 90+ days

**Smoke Test:** Requires local Docker environment (not available in Claude Code environment).

**Next:** Week 46 — Create demo script (5-act, 22 minutes) and stakeholder talking points.

**Version:** v0.9.19-alpha

---

### Week 46: Demo Script & Stakeholder Talking Points ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Create 5-act demo script and audience-specific talking points for stakeholder presentation.

**Status:** ✅ All tasks complete (February 7, 2026)

| Task | Status | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Demo script (5-act)** | ✅ Complete | `docs/demo/DEMO_SCRIPT_v1.md` |
| **Stakeholder talking points** | ✅ Complete | `docs/demo/STAKEHOLDER_TALKING_POINTS.md` |
| **Screenshots directory** | ✅ Complete | `docs/demo/screenshots/` |

**Demo Script Structure:**
- **Act 1**: "The Problem" (2 min) - Set context, show current pain points
- **Act 2**: "The Daily Workflow" (10 min) - Dispatch board, processing referrals, book management, enforcement
- **Act 3**: "The Reports" (5 min) - P0 daily reports, P1 weekly/monthly, P2/P3 analytics
- **Act 4**: "Under the Hood" (3 min) - Docker, audit logs, containment for IT audience
- **Act 5**: "What's Next" (2 min) - LaborPower data ask, roadmap, vision

**Total Runtime:** ~22 minutes

**Stakeholder Talking Points:**
- **Access DB Owner**: Collaboration framing, expertise recognition, complementary positioning (not replacement)
- **IT Contractor**: Containment assurance, self-maintained, Docker isolation, no work created
- **Union Leadership**: Business value, time savings (15-20 min → 2 min), member service, compliance

**Files Created:**
```
docs/demo/DEMO_SCRIPT_v1.md                    # 5-act presentation script (~22 min)
docs/demo/STAKEHOLDER_TALKING_POINTS.md        # Audience-specific messaging
docs/demo/screenshots/                         # Directory for backup visuals
```

**Key Messages:**
- **Access DB owner:** "This complements your database, not replaces it"
- **IT contractor:** "Self-contained, isolated, I maintain it"
- **Union leadership:** "85 reports built, 7-year audit compliance, member self-service"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Demo script created with 5-act structure and timing
- [x] Stakeholder talking points created for all 3 audiences
- [x] Contingency plans documented
- [x] Pre-demo checklist included
- [x] Post-demo follow-up messaging included

**Next:** Stakeholder demo event → if Access DB owner grants LaborPower data access → unblocks 7a/7d → then Square Payment Migration (Weeks 47-49)

**Version:** v0.9.20-alpha

### Data Analysis Status

Two batches of production data analyzed from LaborPower Custom Reports module:

| Batch | Date | Files | Contents |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Batch 1 | Feb 2, 2026 | 12 | Wire SEA/BREM/PA + Technician + Utility Worker reg lists; 7 employer lists |
| Batch 2 | Feb 2, 2026 | 12 | STOCKMAN + TRADESHOW + TERO APPR WIRE + Technician + Utility Worker; 7 employer lists (+ RESIDENTIAL discovery) |
| **Total** | | **24 files** | 4,033 registrations across 8 books; ~843 unique employers across 8 contract codes |

Analysis documents:
- `LaborPower_Data_Analysis_Schema_Guidance_1.docx` — Volume 1 (Batch 1)
- `LaborPower_Data_Analysis_Schema_Guidance_2.docx` — Volume 2 (Batch 2 + schema corrections)
- `UnionCore_Continuity_Document_Consolidated.md` — Master reference merging both volumes

### Critical Schema Findings (8)

| # | Finding | Severity |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **APN = DECIMAL(10,2), NOT INTEGER** — Integer part is Excel serial date, decimal is secondary sort key (.23–.91). INTEGER destroys dispatch ordering. | 🔴 Critical |
| 2 | **Duplicate APNs within books** — Cannot use APN as unique key. Must use UNIQUE(member_id, book_id, book_priority_number). | 🔴 Critical |
| 3 | **RESIDENTIAL = 8th contract code** — 259 employers, 80% also WIREPERSON, 52 residential-only shops. Missing from all prior docs. | 🟡 High |
| 4 | **Book Name ≠ Contract Code** — STOCKMAN book → STOCKPERSON contract. TECHNICIAN/TRADESHOW/UTILITY WORKER have NO matching contract code. Schema must separate book_name, classification, and contract_code. | 🔴 Critical |
| 5 | **TERO APPR WIRE = compound book** — Encodes agreement_type (TERO) + work_level (APPRENTICE) + classification (WIRE). Needs `agreement_type`, `work_level`, `book_type` columns on `referral_books`. | 🟡 High |
| 6 | **Cross-regional registration** — 87% of Wire Book 1 on ALL THREE regional books. registrations table will have ~3× rows vs unique Wire members. | 🟢 Medium |
| 7 | **APN 45880.41 on FOUR books** — One member on Technician, TERO Appr Wire, Tradeshow, Utility Worker simultaneously. Validates many-to-many model. | 🟢 Medium |
| 8 | **Inverted tier distributions** — STOCKMAN Book 3 = 8.6× Book 1; TECHNICIAN Book 3 > Book 1. Strengthens "Book 3 = Travelers" hypothesis. | 🟢 Medium |

### Known Books (11)

| Book Name | Classification | Region | Contract Code | Agreement | Work Level |
|-----------|---------------|--------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| WIRE SEATTLE | Wire | Seattle | WIREPERSON | Standard | Journeyman |
| WIRE BREMERTON | Wire | Bremerton | WIREPERSON | Standard | Journeyman |
| WIRE PT ANGELES | Wire | Pt. Angeles | WIREPERSON | Standard | Journeyman |
| TECHNICIAN | Technician | Jurisdiction-wide | *(unknown)* | Standard | Journeyman |
| UTILITY WORKER | Utility Worker | Jurisdiction-wide | *(unknown)* | Standard | Journeyman |
| STOCKMAN | Stockman | Jurisdiction-wide | STOCKPERSON | Standard | Journeyman |
| TRADESHOW | Tradeshow | Jurisdiction-wide | *(none — supplemental)* | Standard | Journeyman |
| TERO APPR WIRE | Wire | *(unknown)* | *(WIREPERSON?)* | **TERO** | **Apprentice** |
| *(implied)* SOUND & COMM | Sound & Comm | *(unknown)* | SOUND & COMM | Standard | Journeyman |
| *(implied)* LT FXT MAINT | Lt. Fixture Maint. | *(unknown)* | LT FXT MAINT | Standard | Journeyman |
| *(implied)* MARINE | Marine | *(unknown)* | GROUP MARINE | Standard | Journeyman |

**Employer Contract Codes (8 confirmed):** WIREPERSON, SOUND & COMM, STOCKPERSON, LT FXT MAINT, GROUP MARINE, GROUP TV & APPL, MARKET RECOVERY, RESIDENTIAL

### Business Rules (14)

Source: "IBEW Local 46 Referral Procedures" — Effective October 4, 2024

| # | Rule | System Impact |
|---|------|---------------|

| 9 | Short Calls | ≤10 business days; max 2 per cycle; ≤3 days don't count |
| 10 | Check Marks (Penalty) | 2 allowed, 3rd = rolled off that book. Separate per area book |
| 11 | No Check Mark Exceptions | Specialty skills, MOU sites, early starts, under scale, short calls |
| 12 | Quit or Discharge | Rolled off ALL books; 2-week foreperson-by-name blackout |
| 13 | Foreperson By Name | Anti-collusion: cannot be filled by registrants who communicated with employer |
| 14 | Exempt Status | Military, union business, salting, medical, jury duty |

### New Tables (12)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `referral_books` | Book definitions — name, contract_code (NULLABLE), agreement_type, work_level, book_type |
| `registrations` | Member out-of-work entries — APN as DECIMAL(10,2), status, re-sign tracking |
| `employer_contracts` | Employer-to-contract relationships — 8 contract codes including RESIDENTIAL |
| `job_requests` | Employer labor requests — lifecycle: OPEN→FILLED/CANCELLED/EXPIRED |
| `job_requirements` | Per-request skill/cert requirements (junction table) |
| `dispatches` | Referral transactions — links registration → job_request → member → employer |
| `web_bids` | Internet bidding records — BID/NO_BID/RETRACT actions |
| `check_marks` | Penalty tracking — 2 allowed per book, 3rd = roll-off |
| `member_exemptions` | Exempt status periods — 7 reason types |
| `bidding_infractions` | Bidding privilege violations and revocation periods |
| `worksites` | Physical job locations separate from employer entity |
| `blackout_periods` | Quit/discharge restrictions — per member-employer |

### Schema Corrections Applied (9)

| Item | Original Assumption | Corrected To |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| APN data type | INTEGER | DECIMAL(10,2) |
| APN field name | position_number | applicant_priority_number |
| Unique constraint | (member_id, book_id) | (member_id, book_id, book_priority_number) |
| Book tier field | Not explicit | book_priority_number INTEGER (1–4) |
| referral_books.contract_code | NOT NULL | **NULLABLE** (Tradeshow, TERO have no contract) |
| referral_books.agreement_type | Not proposed | **NEW:** VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'STANDARD' |
| referral_books.work_level | Not proposed | **NEW:** VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'JOURNEYMAN' |
| referral_books.book_type | Not proposed | **NEW:** VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PRIMARY' |
| employer_contracts domain | 7 contract codes | **8 codes (+ RESIDENTIAL)** |

### Data Gaps (16)

#### Priority 1 — BLOCKING (before schema DDL)

| # | Gap | How to Resolve |
|---|-----|----------------|
| 1 | REGLIST with member identifiers | LaborPower Custom Report: REGLIST |
| 2 | RAW DISPATCH DATA | LaborPower Custom Report: RAW DISPATCH DATA |
| 3 | EMPLOYCONTRACT report | LaborPower Custom Report: EMPLOYCONTRACT |

#### Priority 2 — IMPORTANT (6 items)
Book catalog confirmation, book-to-contract mapping, sample registration detail, sample dispatch history, TERO/PLA/CWA catalog, duplicate employer resolution strategy.

#### Priority 3 — CLARIFICATION (7 items)
90-day rule definition, "too many days" threshold, total region count, tier semantics, TRADESHOW-specific rules, apprentice book rules, RESIDENTIAL vs WIREPERSON differences.

⚠️ **Do NOT finalize schema DDL or begin migration code until Priority 1 gaps are resolved.**

### Sub-Phases (7a–7g) — 100-150 hrs total

| Sub-Phase | Focus | Hours | Blocked By |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|
| 7a | Data Collection — 3 Priority 1 exports from LaborPower | 3-5 | ⛔ LaborPower access |
| 7b | Schema Finalization — DDL, Alembic migrations, seed data | 10-15 | 7a |
| 7c | Core Services + API — 14 business rules, CRUD, dispatch logic | 25-35 | 7b |
| 7d | Import Tooling — CSV pipeline: employers → registrations → dispatch | 15-20 | 7b (parallel with 7c) |
| 7e | Frontend UI — book management, dispatch board, web bidding | 20-30 | 7c |
| 7f | Reports P0+P1 — 49 critical/high priority reports | 20-30 | 7c |
| 7g | Reports P2+P3 — 29 medium/low priority reports | 10-15 | 7f |

### LaborPower Report Inventory

~78 de-duplicated reports (91 raw) organized by priority:

| Priority | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| P0 (Critical) | 16 | Out-of-work lists, dispatch logs, employer active list |
| P1 (High) | 33 | Registration history, dispatch summaries, check mark reports |
| P2 (Medium) | 22 | Analytics, trend reports, employer utilization |
| P3 (Low) | 7 | Projections, ad-hoc queries |

Full inventory: `docs/phase7/LABORPOWER_REFERRAL_REPORTS_INVENTORY.md`

### ⚠️ Phase 7 Session Reminders

> **Member ≠ Student.** Members are IBEW union members in the referral system. Students are pre-apprenticeship program participants. NEVER conflate. Phase 7 models FK to `members`, NOT `students`.

> **Book ≠ Contract.** Books are out-of-work registration lists. Contracts are collective bargaining agreements. The mapping is NOT 1:1. STOCKMAN book dispatches under STOCKPERSON contract. 3 books have NO contract code.

> **APN = DECIMAL(10,2).** Integer part is Excel serial date. Decimal part (.23–.91) is secondary sort key for same-day dispatch ordering. NEVER truncate to INTEGER.

> **Audit.** `registrations`, `dispatches`, and `check_marks` tables MUST be in AUDITED_TABLES (NLRA 7-year compliance).
