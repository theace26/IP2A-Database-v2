## Check Categories

### 1. Structural Integrity

#### Foreign Key Integrity
Detects orphaned records that reference non-existent parent records.

**Checks:**
- Member employments → Members
- Member employments → Organizations
- Organization contacts → Organizations
- File attachments → Parent records (members, students, organizations)

**Auto-fix:** Delete orphaned records

**Example Issue:**
```
🔴 Employment record 12345 references non-existent member
   → Auto-fix: delete
```

#### Required Fields
Ensures all mandatory fields are populated.

**Checks:**
- Members: member_number, first_name, last_name
- Organizations: name, org_type
- Students: first_name, last_name, email

**Auto-fix:** ❌ Requires manual data entry

**Example Issue:**
```
🔴 Member 789 missing required field(s)
```

#### Enum Values
Validates that enum fields contain only valid values.

**Checks:**
- Member status (active, inactive, suspended, etc.)
- Member classification (journeyman, apprentice_1, etc.)
- Organization type (employer, union, training_partner, jatc)
- Salting score (1-5)

**Auto-fix:** Set to default value (e.g., ACTIVE for status)

**Example Issue:**
```
🔴 Member 456 has invalid status: ACTVE (typo)
   → Auto-fix: set to 'active'
```

### 2. Logical Consistency

#### Date Logic
Validates date relationships and ranges.

**Checks:**
- Employment end_date >= start_date
- is_current=True must have end_date=NULL
- hire_date not in future
- Reasonable date ranges

**Auto-fix:** Set end_date to NULL or is_current to False

**Example Issue:**
```
🔴 Employment 999 has end_date before start_date
   → Auto-fix: set end_date to NULL
```

#### Employment Logic
Validates employment-specific business rules.

**Checks:**
- Members should have 0 or 1 current employment (not multiple)
- Hourly rates in reasonable range ($10-$150)
- Employment history makes sense

**Auto-fix:** ❌ Requires manual review

**Example Issue:**
```
🟡 Member 123 has 3 current employments (should be 0 or 1)
```

#### Contact Logic
Validates organization contact relationships.

**Checks:**
- Organizations should have 0 or 1 primary contact (not multiple)
- Organizations should have at least 1 contact (info only)

**Auto-fix:** Keep most recent as primary, set others to non-primary

**Example Issue:**
```
🟡 Organization 50 has 2 primary contacts (should be 0 or 1)
   → Auto-fix: keep most recent as primary
```

### 3. Data Quality

#### Duplicates
Detects duplicate records that should be unique.

**Checks:**
- Duplicate member numbers
- Duplicate student emails
- Duplicate organization names (info only)

**Auto-fix:** ❌ Requires manual deduplication

**Example Issue:**
```
🔴 Duplicate member_number: 7001234 (3 records)
```

#### Data Anomalies
Identifies unusual patterns that may indicate issues.

**Checks:**
- Active members with no employment history
- Unusually high/low hourly rates
- Missing optional data that's usually present

**Auto-fix:** ❌ Info only

**Example Issue:**
```
🔵 250 active members have no employment history
```

### 4. File System Integrity

#### File Attachments
Validates file attachment records and file system.

**Checks:**
- File path exists and is not NULL
- Referenced files exist on disk (local storage)
- File sizes are reasonable (<100 MB)
- File extensions match MIME types

**Auto-fix:**
- ✅ Delete records with no file_path
- ⚠️ Interactive for missing files (user decides: delete, keep, or reattach)

**Example Issue:**
```
🟡 Attachment 5678 file not found: uploads/member/2024/03/missing.pdf
   → Requires interactive repair (user decision)
```

**Note:** File system checks can be slow for large datasets (100k+ attachments). Use `--no-files` to skip.

## Repair Process

### Auto-Repair Flow

1. **Identify Issues** - Run all integrity checks
2. **Filter Auto-Fixable** - Select issues with automated fixes
3. **Group by Category** - Organize repairs logically
4. **Execute Repairs** - Apply fixes in order
5. **Commit Changes** - Save all changes in single transaction
6. **Generate Report** - Summarize actions taken

### Interactive Repair Flow

1. **Identify Complex Issues** - Filter issues requiring user input
2. **Present Options** - Show details and available actions
3. **User Decides** - Choose: delete, keep, skip, or batch action
4. **Execute Action** - Apply user's choice
5. **Repeat** - Continue until all issues resolved or user aborts
6. **Commit Changes** - Save all interactive decisions

### Dry Run Mode

Dry run mode allows you to preview repairs without making changes:

```bash
python run_integrity_check.py --repair --dry-run
```

**Behavior:**
- All checks run normally
- Repair logic executes
- Changes are **NOT** committed to database
- Session is rolled back at end
- Report shows what **would** be done

**Output:**
```
⚠️  DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made

🔧 Starting Auto-Repair Process
...
✅ Fixed: Employment record 12345 references non-existent member
   → Would delete orphaned record

⚠️  Dry run complete - no changes made
```

## Scheduled Maintenance

### Recommended Schedule

For multi-user production environments:

```bash
# Daily integrity check (read-only, no repairs)
0 2 * * * cd /app && python run_integrity_check.py --export /var/log/integrity_daily.txt

# Weekly auto-repair during maintenance window
0 3 * * 0 cd /app && python run_integrity_check.py --repair --no-files

# Monthly full check with file system (slower)
0 4 1 * * cd /app && python run_integrity_check.py --repair
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Run integrity check on staging data
2. ✅ Review and fix all critical issues
3. ✅ Test auto-repair with --dry-run
4. ✅ Document any manual fixes needed
5. ✅ Schedule downtime for repairs if needed

### Post-Import Validation

After importing large datasets:

```bash
# Check data quality immediately
python run_integrity_check.py

# Auto-repair common import issues
python run_integrity_check.py --repair --dry-run
python run_integrity_check.py --repair
```

---

## Multi-User Considerations

### Concurrent Access

The integrity checker is designed for multi-user environments:

- **Read operations** - Safe to run while users are active
- **Repair operations** - Require exclusive access or maintenance window
- **Interactive repairs** - Best during low-activity periods

### Locking Strategy

During repairs:
- Uses row-level locks (not table locks)
- Commits in single transaction (all or nothing)
- Minimal disruption to other users
- Fast repair operations (< 1 second per fix)

### Best Practices

1. **Run checks frequently** (daily read-only)
2. **Schedule repairs during maintenance** (weekly/monthly)
3. **Monitor critical issues** (alert if count increases)
4. **Keep audit logs** (export reports to files)
5. **Test repairs on staging** (before production)

---

## Automation Examples

### Example 1: Daily Health Check

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily_health_check.sh

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
REPORT_DIR="/var/log/integrity_reports"

# Run check and export report
python run_integrity_check.py \
    --no-files \
    --export "$REPORT_DIR/integrity_$DATE.txt"

# Count critical issues
CRITICAL=$(grep "🔴 Critical Issues:" "$REPORT_DIR/integrity_$DATE.txt" | awk '{print $4}')

# Alert if critical issues found
if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Found $CRITICAL critical integrity issues"
    # Send alert (email, Slack, etc.)
fi
```

### Example 2: Weekly Auto-Repair

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# weekly_repair.sh

# Test repairs first
python run_integrity_check.py --repair --dry-run --no-files

# If dry run looks good, execute
read -p "Execute repairs? (yes/no): " CONFIRM

if [ "$CONFIRM" = "yes" ]; then
    python run_integrity_check.py --repair --no-files
    echo "✅ Weekly repair complete"
else
    echo "❌ Repair cancelled"
fi
```

### Example 3: Post-Import Validation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate_import.sh

# After data import, check integrity
python run_integrity_check.py --export import_validation.txt

# Review report
cat import_validation.txt

# Fix auto-fixable issues
python run_integrity_check.py --repair

# Check again to confirm
python run_integrity_check.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Check is too slow

**Cause:** File system checks on large datasets (100k+ attachments)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Skip file checks
python run_integrity_check.py --no-files
```

### Issue: Too many orphaned records

**Cause:** Data import without proper foreign key validation

**Solution:**
```bash
# Auto-delete orphaned records
python run_integrity_check.py --repair
```

### Issue: Repairs fail with database locked

**Cause:** Other users have locks on records being repaired

**Solution:**
- Schedule repairs during maintenance window
- Ask users to log out temporarily
- Check `pg_stat_activity` for blocking queries

### Issue: Duplicate member numbers

**Cause:** Import process allowed duplicates

**Solution:**
Manual deduplication required:
1. Export duplicates to CSV
2. Review with business team
3. Merge or delete duplicates manually
4. Re-run integrity check

### Issue: "Database is locked"
- Schedule during maintenance window
- Check for long-running queries: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;`

### Issue: "Permission denied"
- Make script executable: `chmod +x run_integrity_check.py`
- Check database permissions

### Issue: "Blocked in production"
- Add `--force` flag (use with caution)
- Consider running on staging first
