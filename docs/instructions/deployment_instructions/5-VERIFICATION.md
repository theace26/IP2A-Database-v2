## Common Issues & Fixes

### CSS/JS Not Loading
- Check static files are included in Docker build
- Verify StaticFiles mount in main.py
- Check browser console for 404s

### Database Errors
- Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Verify database is running

### Session/Cookie Issues
- Check SECRET_KEY is set
- Verify HTTPS is working (cookies require secure)
- Clear browser cookies and retry

### S3 Upload Fails
- Verify all S3_* environment variables
- Check bucket permissions
- Test with shell script from Step 6 of S3 guide

### Slow Render Response
- Free tier sleeps after 15 min
- First request takes ~30 seconds
- Use keep-alive service or upgrade

---

## Performance Check

Use browser DevTools Network tab:

| Metric | Acceptable | Good |
|--------|------------|------|
| Initial page load | < 3s | < 1s |
| HTMX partial update | < 500ms | < 200ms |
| Login response | < 1s | < 500ms |
| Report generation | < 10s | < 5s |

---

## Final Verification

Once all tests pass:

```bash
# Ensure you're on develop
git checkout develop

# Tag the verified release (on develop for reference)
git tag -a v0.8.0 -m "Production deployment verified

Verified deployments:
- Railway: https://xxx.up.railway.app
- Render: https://xxx.onrender.com

All verification tests passing
Branch strategy: main (demo) / develop (work)"

git push origin v0.8.0

# Main branch already has these changes from earlier merge
# Both Railway and Render are deploying from main
```

**Branch Status:**
- `main` → Deployed to Railway + Render (stable demo)
- `develop` → Your working branch (continues development)
