## UI Patterns

### SALTing Score Display (1-5)
```html
<!-- Score badges -->
<div class="rating rating-sm">
    {% for i in range(1, 6) %}
    <span class="mask mask-star-2 {{ 'bg-warning' if i <= activity.score else 'bg-base-300' }}"></span>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
<span class="text-sm ml-2">{{ activity.score }}/5</span>
```

### Benevolence Status Workflow
```
PENDING → APPROVED → PAID → CLOSED
    ↓
  DENIED → CLOSED
```

### Grievance Step Progress
```html
<ul class="steps steps-horizontal w-full">
    <li class="step {{ 'step-primary' if grievance.current_step >= 1 else '' }}">Step 1</li>
    <li class="step {{ 'step-primary' if grievance.current_step >= 2 else '' }}">Step 2</li>
    <li class="step {{ 'step-primary' if grievance.current_step >= 3 else '' }}">Step 3</li>
    <li class="step {{ 'step-primary' if grievance.current_step >= 4 else '' }}">Arbitration</li>
</ul>
```

## HTMX Patterns

### Live Search (consistent with previous weeks)
```html
<input
    type="search"
    name="q"
    hx-get="/operations/salting/search"
    hx-trigger="input changed delay:300ms, search"
    hx-target="#table-container"
    hx-include="[name='status'], [name='score']"
/>
```

### Status Update (inline)
```html
<select
    name="status"
    hx-post="/operations/salting/{{ activity.id }}/status"
    hx-trigger="change"
    hx-swap="outerHTML"
    class="select select-bordered select-sm"
>
    {% for status in all_statuses %}
    <option value="{{ status }}" {{ 'selected' if activity.status.value == status }}>
        {{ status | title }}
    </option>
    {% endfor %}
</select>
```

## Documentation Requirements

### MUST Update (Every Session)
1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Add features under `[Unreleased]`
2. **IP2A_MILESTONE_CHECKLIST.md** - Check off completed tasks
3. **Session Log** - Create `docs/reports/session-logs/2026-01-XX-phase6-week6.md`

### MUST Update (End of Week)
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Update current status and next steps
2. **README.md** (docs/) - Update version and component status
3. **docs/guides/** - If new patterns introduced

### SHOULD Create (If Applicable)
1. **ADR** - If significant architectural decisions made
   - Example: ADR-009 for Union Operations UI patterns
   - Example: ADR-010 for HTMX partial loading strategy
