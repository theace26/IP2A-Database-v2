**Version:** 0.7.6 → 0.7.7
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours (3 sessions)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 Week 7 complete, ~284 tests passing

---

## Overview

Week 8 implements report generation capabilities:
- PDF generation for certificates and formal reports
- Excel export for data analysis
- Report templates for members, dues, training
- Download infrastructure

This provides leadership with exportable data and printable documents.

## Dependencies

Add to `requirements.txt`:
```
weasyprint==60.1      # PDF generation
openpyxl==3.1.2       # Excel generation
```

**Note:** WeasyPrint requires system dependencies:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (in Dockerfile)
apt-get install -y libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0
```

## Architecture

### ReportService Pattern
```python
class ReportService:
    """Base class for report generation."""

    @staticmethod
    def generate_pdf(template: str, context: dict) -> bytes:
        """Generate PDF from HTML template."""
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def generate_excel(data: list[dict], columns: list[str]) -> bytes:
        """Generate Excel from data."""
        pass
```

### Report Types

| Report | Format | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Member Roster | PDF/Excel | All members with contact info |
| Dues Summary | PDF/Excel | Period collection summary |
| Overdue Report | PDF/Excel | Members with overdue dues |
| Training Completion | PDF | Individual certificates |
| Course Enrollment | Excel | Students per course |
| Grievance Summary | PDF | Open/closed grievances |
| SALTing Report | Excel | Activities with outcomes |

## Routes to Implement

| Route | Method | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `/reports` | GET | HTML | Reports landing page |
| `/reports/members/roster` | GET | PDF/Excel | Member roster |
| `/reports/dues/summary` | GET | PDF/Excel | Dues period summary |
| `/reports/dues/overdue` | GET | PDF/Excel | Overdue members |
| `/reports/training/certificate/{student_id}` | GET | PDF | Completion certificate |
| `/reports/training/enrollment` | GET | Excel | Course enrollments |
| `/reports/operations/grievances` | GET | PDF | Grievance summary |
| `/reports/operations/salting` | GET | Excel | SALTing activities |

Query parameter `?format=pdf` or `?format=excel` determines output.

## 📝 End-of-Session Documentation (REQUIRED)

> ⚠️ **DO NOT skip this step.** Update *ANY* and *ALL* relevant documents to capture progress made this session.

### Before Ending This Session:

1. **Scan `/docs/*`** - Review all documentation files
2. **Update existing docs** - Reflect changes, progress, and decisions
3. **Create new docs** - If needed for new components or concepts
4. **ADR Review** - Update or create Architecture Decision Records as necessary
5. **Session log entry** - Record what was accomplished

This ensures historical record-keeping and project continuity ("bus factor" protection).
