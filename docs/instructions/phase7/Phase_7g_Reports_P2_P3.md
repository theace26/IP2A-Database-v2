# SUB-PHASE 7g: REPORTS P2 + P3

**Status:** Stub — Waiting on 7f
**Estimated Effort:** 10-15 hours
**Prerequisites:** 7f complete — P0+P1 report patterns established
**Spoke:** Spoke 2 or Spoke 3
**Parent:** [Phase 7 Framework](Phase_7_Subphase_Instruction_Framework.md)

## Objective

Build the 29 lower-priority reports (22 P2 + 7 P3) covering analytics, historical trends, and projections.

## P2 Reports (22 — Analytics)

Trend analysis, historical comparisons, utilization rates. These reports aggregate data over time and benefit from Chart.js visualization.

## P3 Reports (7 — Projections)

Workforce projections, demand forecasting, ad-hoc query tools. These are the most complex reports, potentially integrating with the custom report builder from Week 19.

## Expected Output

- Additional report templates
- Chart.js integration for trend visualizations
- Custom report builder extension for referral entities
- Tests for each report

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 22 P2 reports generate correctly
- [ ] All 7 P3 reports generate correctly
- [ ] Chart.js visualizations for trend reports
- [ ] Custom report builder supports referral entities
- [ ] Tests for each report
- [ ] CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Phase 7 marked COMPLETE in all project docs

## ⚠️ NOT YET READY — Waiting on 7f (report patterns must be established first)
