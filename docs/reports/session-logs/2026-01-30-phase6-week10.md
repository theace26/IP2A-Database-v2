## Test Results

- Dues Frontend Tests: 37 passing

## Technical Decisions

### Modal Workflows
Used Alpine.js modals for:
- Generate Year (periods)
- Close Period (periods)
- Record Payment (payments)
- Approve/Deny Adjustment (adjustments)

### HTMX Filter Pattern
Consistent pattern across all list pages:
```html
<input
    hx-get="/dues/{module}/search"
    hx-trigger="input changed delay:300ms"
    hx-target="#table-container"
    hx-include="[name='filter1'], [name='filter2']"
/>
```

### Status Badge Colors
Followed semantic meaning across all modules:
- Success (green): paid, approved
- Warning (yellow): pending
- Error (red): overdue, denied
- Ghost (gray): waived, closed

## Blockers & Issues

None encountered.

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment Prep**
   - Railway/Render setup
   - Environment configuration
   - Production database setup

2. **Demo to Leadership**
   - Prepare demo environment
   - Create walkthrough script

## Metrics
